    <h2>My life at Kennesaw State University .... Not what you think.</h2>
    <p>That's right. I'm not your average KSU student. As being a proud growing member of adults choosing to go back to school, 
      I'm proud to have the opportunity toe attend KSU. It is said that over 35% of college students are over 25 years old. Out of that 
      27% of those folks are having to work full time while going to college full time. I belong to that category. Even with all of the years 
      working in corporate and being able to carry all of those life exeriences with me, it's still a struggle to do school work. The older you get, 
      the more responsbilities there are and the harder it is to obtain your dreams and aspirations.  If I had to give one advice to my fellow KSU
      classmates, that would be to do it while you're young. You will save time, money, and energy. </p>
    <p>If you're in my boat and want more information on KSU as an adult resturning back to college, check out:

    <h2>Passion + Golfing  = Health Benefits?</h2>
    <p>The National Golf Foundation reports that in the United States alone, over 42 million 
      people golf annually and it has increased year of year. I love to golf. There I said it.  
      Even though my wife doesn't like missing me on weekends to go golfing with the boys, 
      I have several reasons in doing so. It's partly for work, socializing, and it's healthy!  
      Golf is placed at a leisurely pace and allows me to take in the beautiful scenery, fresh air,
      and talk with friends. There is also a lot of walking involved. Walking promotes heart health, improves cholesterol
    while the golfing posture improves balance. There are many other health benefits such as increase of good moood, bone 
    density and joint health. I would say personally, that the best benefit for me is that my wife realizes the same time things
    and will begrudgently let me go golfing as much as I want to.</p>

    <h2>CyberAttacks: Are you at risk</h2>
    <p>As mentioned in my biography, my major at KSU is in Information Security.  I've been in IT for about 30 years now and out of those,
    I've been in InfoSec for about 16 years. I can't even begin to tell you how easy anyone can fall into scam traps by phishing emails.
    This is one of the most common scams in the corporate World. Someon impersonating another co-worker and you innocently click on the link
    and that's all it takes to open the door for a cyber crime. </p>
    <p>So protect yourself by reading up on some news about what types of cyberattacks are heppending in real time.
